# academic_papers_bot
A simple bot for generating paper titles based on original ones obtained from Google Scholar.

This repository functions as an exrcise for learning the functioning of the LSTM model. The overall project is still in a WIP state.

Covered:

* Scraper for obtaining paper titles from Google Scholar.
* Parser for preprocessing the .txt file in a format suitable for the LSTM model.
* Model creator for building and training the LSTM model
* Initial bot implementation for generating new titles employing the trained LSTM model 

To do:

* Make the bot interfacing with the twitter API
