# ScholHAL: generating science (fiction) sound papers' titles 

A simple bot for generating paper titles based on original ones obtained from Google Scholar.

This repository serves as an exrcise for learning about the Keras implementation of LSTM. The overall project is still in a WIP state.

Covered:

* Scraper for obtaining papers' titles from Google Scholar.
* Parser for preprocessing the .txt file in a format suitable for the LSTM.
* Model creator for building and training the LSTM.
* Initial bot implementation for generating new titles employing the trained LSTM model.

To do:

* Make the bot interfacing with the twitter API.
